Application Instructions

1. Select file:
	Browse through your files and select a .csv file you have entered data into
2. Sections in bunk:
	A section is defined as a continuous stretch of bunks.
	How many continuous stretches are in the bunk you are attempting to fill?
3. Bunks in each section:
	Enter the number of top and bottom bunks in each section of the bunk.
	The section numbers are as you define them.
4. Loops:
	This is the number of times the program runs.
	A higher number gives a better result, to a certain extent.
	30 loops is considered a good result, but more is better if possible.
	The time for each loop is usually 1-2 minutes, but allow for up to 3 for large bunks/slow devices.
5. Time Remaining:
	The program is running, and you will get an output at the end.
6. Display:
	The bunk sections will be displayed separately.
	Top bunks are on top, and bottom bunks are on bottom.
	Occasionally, there will be multiple, equally satisfactory layouts.
	To switch between them, use the previous and next buttons.
	However, there is usually one arrangement.
